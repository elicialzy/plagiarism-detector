The number of received scientific stimulus and was carried to a degree of intellectual sophistication is very low, and a happy accident that is genius among the small number must be very rare. And in this respect, it is noteworthy that the Russians who feels called to the artistic production almost always show a trend of view of epic composition. Difficulties as the Russian seem terrible. In love, written as he embarrasses less and therefore have almost all the throws in the making of novels. As is generally the case in the early literature of every nation, every writer in Russia is taken for a miracle, and looked with astonishment. Kukolnik playwright is an example. He wrote a good deal for the theater, but nothing is as it should be praised as much as his zeal in imitation. It must be admitted that in this he possesses a remarkable degree of dexterity. He soon became the area's favorite love, but this also he shows weakness at the national level. In each of his numerous works the most striking feature is the lack of organization. They were completed with no beginning and author ever thought a plot, or mode of treatment. Kukolnik it \\\"\\\"Alf and Adoni\\\"\\\", in which at least one hundred and fifty characters are brought on stage, is not one whose appearance is designed to focus public interest. Each comes to show, and not just go to any more.
