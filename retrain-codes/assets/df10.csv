acquired by his gallantry at the battle of Sandal, by murdering his youthful prisoner the Earl
of Rutland, in cold blood, at the termination of it, has gained a passport to an odious immortality
from the soaring genius of the bard of Avon. But his real fate is far more striking, both in
a moral and in a poetical point of view, than that assigned to him by our great dramatist.
On the evening before the battle of Towton Field, and after the termination of the skirmish
which preceded it, an unknown archer shot him in the throat, as he was putting off his gorget,
and so avenged the wretched victims, whose blood he had shed like water upon Wakefield Bridge.
The vengeance of the Yorkists was not, however, satiated by the death of the Butcher, as Leland
informs us that they called him:--for they attainted him, in the first year of the reign of
Edward the Fourth, and granted his estates, a few years afterwards, to the Duke of Gloucester,
who retained them in his iron grasp till he lost them with his crown and life at the battle
of Bosworth. The history of his son is a romance ready made. One of the first acts of Henry
the Seventh, after his accession to the throne, was to reverse the attainder which had been
passed against his father; and immediately afterwards the young lord emerged from the hiding
place, where he had been brought up in ignorance of his rank, and with the manners and education
of a mere shepherd. His son, who was the first Earl of Cumberland, embittered the conclusion
of his life, by embarking in a series of adventures, which, in spite of their profligacy, or
rather in consequence of it, possess a very strong romantic interest. Finding that his father
was either unwilling or unable to furnish him with funds to maintain his inordinate riot and
luxury, he became the leader of a band of outlaws, and, by their agency, levied aids and benevolences
upon the different travellers on the king's highway. A letter of the old lord, his father,
which, by the by, is not the letter of an illiterate man, is still extant, in which he complains
in very moving terms of his son's degeneracy and misconduct. The young scapegrace, wishing
to make his father know from experience the inconvenience of being scantily supplied with money,
enjoined his tenantry in Craven not to pay their rents, and beat one of them, Henry Popely,
who ventured to disobey him, so severely with his own hand, that he lay for a long time in
peril of death. He spoiled his father's houses, &c. ""feloniously took away his proper goods,""
as the old lord quaintly observes, ""apparelling himself and his horse, all the time, in cloth
of gold and goldsmith's work, more like a duke than a poor baron's son."" He likewise took a
particular aversion to the religious orders, ""shamefully beating their tenants and servants,
in such wise as some whole towns were fain to keep the churches both night and day, and durst
not come at their own houses.""--Whilst engaged in these ignoble practices, less dissonant,
however, to the manners of his age than to those of our's, he wooed, and won, and married,
a daughter of the Percy of Northumberland; and it is conjectured, upon very plausible grounds,
that his courtship and marriage with a lady of the highest rank under such disadvantages on
his part, gave rise to the beautiful old ballad of the Nutbrown Maid.

laugh; while the girl's graceful figure, slight and maidenly, yet perfectly proportioned, seemed
instinct with the same feeling of contemptuous amusement.

The play, which seemed long enough to me, might have lasted longer, seeing that no one there
had pity on me, had I not, in my desperation, espied a door at the farther end of the room,
and concluded, seeing no other, that it was the door of the king's bedchamber. The mortification
I was suffering was so great that I did not hesitate, but advanced with boldness towards it.
On the instant there was a lull in the laughter round me, and half a dozen voices called on
me to stop.

'I have come to see the king,' I answered, turning on them fiercely, for I was by this time
in no mood for browbeating, 'and I will see him!'

'He is out hunting,' cried all with one accord; and they signed imperiously to me to go back
the way I had come.

But having the king's appointment safe in my pouch, I thought I had good reason to disbelieve
them; and taking advantage of their surprise--for they had not expected so bold a step on my
part--I was at the door before they could prevent me. I heard Mathurine, the fool, who had
sprung to her feet, cry 'Pardieu! he will take the Kingdom of Heaven by force!' and those were
the last words I heard; for, as I lifted the latch--there was no one on guard there--a sudden
swift silence fell upon the room behind me.

I pushed the door gently open and went in. There were two men sitting in one of the windows,
who turned and looked angrily towards me. For the rest the room was empty. The king's walking-shoes
lay by his chair, and beside them the boot-hooks and jack. A dog before the fire got up slowly
and growled, and one of the men, rising from the trunk on which he had been sitting, came towards
me and asked me, with every sign of irritation, what I wanted there, and who had given me leave
to enter.

I was beginning to explain, with some diffidence the stillness of the room sobering me--that
I wished to see the king, when he who had advanced took me up sharply with, 'The king? the
king? He is not here, man. He is hunting at St. Valery. Did they not tell you so outside?'

I thought I recognised the speaker, than whom I have seldom seen a man more grave and thoughtful
for his years, which were something less than mine, more striking in presence, or more soberly
dressed. And being desirous to evade his question, I asked him if I had not the honour to address
M. du Plessis Mornay; for that wise and courtly statesman, now a pillar of Henry's counsels,
it was.

'The same, sir,' he replied, abruptly, and without taking his eyes from me. 'I am Mornay. What
of that?'

'I am M. de Marsac,' I explained. And there I stopped, supposing that, as he was in the king's
confidence, this would make my errand clear to him.

But I was disappointed. 'Well, sir?' he said, and waited impatiently.

So cold a reception, following such treatment as I had suffered outside, would have sufficed
to have dashed my spirits utterly had I not felt the king's letter in my pocket. Being pretty
confident, however, that a single glance at this would alter M. du Mornay's bearing for the
better, I hastened, looking on it as a kind of talisman, to draw it out and present it to him.

He took it, and looked at it, and opened it, but with so cold and immovable an aspect as made
my heart sink more than all that had gone before. 'What is amiss?' I cried, unable to keep
silence. ''Tis from the king, sir.'

'A king in motley!' he answered, his lip curling.

The sense of his words did not at once strike home to me, and I murmured, in great disorder,
that the king had sent for me.

'The king knows nothing of it,' was his blunt answer, bluntly given. And he thrust the paper
back into my hands. 'It is a trick,' he continued, speaking with the same abruptness, 'for
which you have doubtless to thank some of those idle young rascals without. You had sent an
application to the king, I suppose? Just so. No doubt they got hold of it, and this is the
result. They ought to be whipped.'

It was not possible for me to doubt any longer that what he said was true. I saw in a moment
all my hopes vanish, all my plans flung to the winds; and in the first shock of the discovery
I could neither find voice to answer him nor strength to withdraw. In a kind of vision I seemed
to see my own lean, haggard face looking at me as in a glass, and, reading despair in my eyes,
could have pitied myself.

My disorder was so great that M. du Mornay observed it. Looking more closely at me, he two
or three times muttered my name, and at last said, 'M. de Marsac? Ha! I remember.
","The play, which seemed long enough to me, might have lasted longer, seeing that no one there had pity on me, had I not, in my desperation, espied a door at the farther end of the room, and concluded, seeing no other, that it was the door of the king's bedchamber.

SCOTTISH ECONOMY.

SHAVINGS V. COAL AND PEAT.

(To the Editor.)

Without intending to be angry, permit me to inform your well-meaning correspondent, M.L.B.
that his observations on the inhabitants of ""Auld Reekie,"" are something like the subject of
his communication ""Shavings,"" rather superficial.

Improvidence forms no feature in the Scottish character; but your flying tourist charges ""the
gude folk o' Embro'"" with monstrous extravagance in making bonfires of their carpenters' chips;
and proceeds to reflect in the true spirit of civilization how much better it would have been
if the builders' chips had been used in lighting household fires, to the obviously great saving
of bundle-wood, than to have thus wantonly forced them to waste their gases on the desert air.
But your traveller forgot that in countries which abound in wheat, rye is seldom eaten; and
that on the same principle, in Scotland, where coal and peat are abundant, the ""natives,"" like
the ancient Vestals, never allow their fires to go out, but keep them burning through the whole
night. The business of the ""gude man"" is, immediately before going to bed, to load the fire
with coals, and crown the supply with a ""canny passack o' turf,"" which keeps the whole in a
state of gentle combustion; when, in the morning a sturdy thrust from the poker, produces an
instantaneous blaze. But, unfortunately, should any untoward ""o'er-night clishmaclaver"" occasion
the neglect of this duty, and the fire be left, like envy, to feed upon its own vitals, a remedy
is at hand in the shape of a pan ""o' live coals"" from some more provident neighbour, resident
in an upper or lower ""flat;"" and thus without bundle-wood or ""shavings,"" is the mischief cured.

I hope that this explanation will sufficiently vindicate my Scottish friends from M.L.B.'s
aspersion. Scotchmen improvident! never: for workhouses are as scarce among them as bundle-wood,
or intelligent travellers. Recollect that I am not in a passion; but this I will say, though
the gorge choke me, that M.L.B. strongly reminds me of the French princess, who when she heard
of some manufacturers dying in the provinces of starvation, said, ""Poor fools! die of starvation--if
I were them I would eat bread and cheese first.""

The next time M.L.B. visits Scotland, let him ask the first peasant he meets how to keep eggs
fresh for years; and he will answer rub a little oil or butter over them, within a day or two
after laying, and they will keep any length of time, perfectly fresh. This discovery, which
was made in France by the great Reamur, depends for its success upon the oil filling up the
pores of the egg-shell, and thereby cutting off the perspiration between the fluids of the
egg and the atmosphere, which is a necessary agent in putrefaction. The preservation of eggs
in this manner, has long been practised in all ""braid Scotland;"" but it is not so much as known
in our own boasted land of stale eggs and bundle-wood.
","There are niches in different parts which held the holy water once, by which faithful devotees of former times sprinkled their foreheads upon entering before the altar, I am not aware of any remains other than those of the old church which are now visible in this chapel. Passing through the eastern end of the southern aisle, two gates lead into the Virgin Mary's Chapel.""

From what we can recall of this Chapel's character, architecture lovers do not have much to mourn in its removal. E.E., our Correspondent, adds that ""This, and not the Lady Chapel, it was, (No. 456 of The Mirror,) that contained the gravestone of one Bishop Wickham, who, however, was not the famous builder of Windsor Castle, in the time of Edward III., but died in 1595, the same year in which he was translated from the see of Lincoln to that of Winchester.

SCOTTISH ECONOMY.

SHAVINGS V. COAL & PEAT.

{To the Editor.)

Entirely meaning no anger whatsoever, allow me to inform your well-intentioned correspondent, M.L.B., that his observations on the denizes of ""Auld Reekie"" are rather like the topic of his earlier work ""Shavings,"" in that they are quite shallow.

Though one would fail to consider improvidence a feature in the Scottish character, your flying tourist charges ""the gude folk o
 Embro"" with grand indulgences in making bonfires from their carpenters' chips; and reflects in the true heart of civilization how much preferable it might have been for the builder's chips to have been used in lighting household fires, obviously saving bundle-wood in great quantities, than to have so recklessly forced them to waste their gases on the desert air. But your traveller neglected to remember that in certain countries wherein wheat in bountiful, rye is scarely consumed; and on that same principle, where coal and peat are abundant, as they are in Scotland, the ""natives"" like ancient Vestals would never let their fires burn out, but keep them burning through the night. The business of such a ""gude man"" is then, immediately before leaving to reset, to load coals onto the fire, and top the supply with a ""canny passack o' turf,"" which maintains the flames in a state of gentle combustion; when, that next morning, provides an instant flame. But, unfortunately, should any inconvenient ""o'er-night clishmaclaver"" happen to neglect this duty, leaving the fire to feed enviously upon itself, a remedy is readily available in the form of a pan ""o' live coals"" from a more fortunate neighbour, living an upper or lower ""flat;"" and so is the mischief cured in the absence of bundle-wood or ""shavings"".

It is my hope that this explanation will sufficiently free my friends the Scots from M.L.B.'s aspersion. The Scots, thriftless? Never! Workhouses are as scarce in Scotland as bundle-wood, or clever tourists. Remember that I am not impassioned; yet I will say, though the gorge may choke me, that M.L.B. reminds me strongly of that French princess, who upon hearing of manufacturers dying of starvation, cried, ""Poor fools! Die of starvation -- if I were them I would eat bread and cheese first.""

Upon M.L.B.'s next visit to Scotland, pray him ask the first peasant he may encounter how one keeps eggs fresh for years; and he will reply that one must rub a little butter or oil over them within two days of laying, and they will remain perfectly fresh for any length of time. This discovery, made in France by the esteem Reamur, is dependent for success upon the oil filling the pores of the egg-shell, and thereby preventing the perspiration of the egg's fluids into the atmosphere -- a necessary agent in putrefaction. Preserving eggs in such a way has long been practiced throughout ""braid Scotland;"" yet it is rather less well-known in our own esteemed nation of stale eggs and bundle-wood.

LUMINOUS PAINT.

In answer to various inquiries concerning the manufacture of this article, we give herewith
the process of William Henry Balmain, the original discoverer of luminous paint, and also other
processes. These particulars are derived from the letters patent granted in this country to
the parties named.

Balmain's invention was patented in England in 1877, and in this country in 1882. It is styled
as Improvements in Painting, Varnishing, and Whitewashing, of which the following is a specification:

The said invention consists in a luminous paint, the body of which is a phosphorescent compound,
or is composed in part of such a compound, and the vehicle of which is such as is used as the
vehicle in ordinary paint compounds, viz., one which becomes dry by evaporation or oxidation.

The objector article to which such paint or varnish or wash is applied is itself rendered visible
in the darkest place, and more or less capable of imparting light to other objects, so as to
render them visible also. The phosphorescent substance found most suitable for the purpose
is a compound obtained by simply heating together a mixture of lime and sulphur, or carbonate
of lime and sulphur, or some of the various substances containing in themselves both lime and
sulphur--such, for example, as alabaster, gypsum, and the like--with carbon or other agent
to remove a portion of the oxygen contained in them, or by heating lime or carbonate of lime
in a gas or vapor containing sulphur.

The vehicle to be used for the luminous paint must be one which will dry by evaporation or
oxidation, in order that the paint may not become soft or fluid by heat or be liable to be
easily rubbed off by accident or use from the articles to which it has been applied. It may
be any of the vehicles commonly used in oil-painting or any of those commonly used in what
is known as ""distemper"" painting or whitewashing, according to the place or purpose in or for
which the paint is to be used.

It is found the best results are obtained by mixing the phosphorescent substance with a colorless
varnish made with mastic or other resinous body and turpentine or spirit, making the paint
as thick as convenient to apply with a brush, and with as much turpentine or spirit as can
be added without impairing the required thickness. Good results may, however, be obtained with
drying oils, spirit varnishes, gums, pastes, sizes, and gelatine solutions of every description,
the choice being varied to meet the object in view or the nature of the article in hand.

The mode of applying the paint, varnish, or wash will also depend upon the circumstances of
the case. For example, it may be applied by a brush, as in ordinary painting, or by dipping
or steeping the article in the paint, varnish, or wash; or a block or type may be used to advantage,
as in calico-printing and the like. For outdoor work, or wherever the surface illuminated is
exposed to the vicissitudes of weather or to injury from mechanical contingencies, it is desirable
to cover it with glass, or, if the article will admit of it, to glaze it over with a flux,
as in enameling, or as in ordinary pottery, and this may be accomplished without injury to
the effect, even when the flux or glaze requires a red heat for fusion.

Among other applications of the said invention which may be enumerated, it is particularly
advantageous for rendering visible clock or watch faces and other indicators--such, for example,
as compasses and the scales of barometers or thermometers--during the night or in dark places
during the night time. In applying the invention to these and other like purposes there may
be used either phosphorescent grounds with dark figures or dark grounds and phosphorescent
figures or letters, preferring the former. In like manner there may be produced figures and
letters for use on house-doors and ends of streets, wherever it is not convenient or economical
to have external source of light, signposts, and signals, and names or marks to show entries
to avenues or gates, and the like.

The invention is also applicable to the illumination of railway carriages by painting with
phosphorescent paint a portion of the interior, thus obviating the necessity for the expense
and inconvenience of the use of lamps in passing through tunnels.
","If the tube is screwed into the socket of dust mixed with oleic acid. Water enters the first to make linseed sticky powder. Late oleate time of formation of lime and oleate of lead, on the way to the outside air, it presses into the holes and closes them completely.

After years of using the tube can be easily otvintva and screws perfectly smooth.

With this type of packaging is only one exception must be made - something that only the strong pressure, condensation or vacuum must be carefully avoided .-- Chem. News.

Illuminated paint.

In response to other questions related to this article, we give this process, William Henry Balmain, the original discoverer of light paint, and other processes. These data were obtained letters patent of the State, the name of the country.

Balmain invention was patented in England in the 1877 and in this country in 1882. It is in the form of improvements in the painting, painting and whitewashing, which has the following characteristics:

The invention consists in a light color, whose body phosphorus compounds, or is part of such a substance and a vehicle such that it is used as a tool in conventional paint compounds, ie 1, which becomes dry by evaporation of oxidation.

Article of the enemy, which paint or varnish or rinse is used by itself are visible in a dark place, more or less capable of transmitting light of other sites in order to make them visible as well. In phosphorescent substance found most suitable for this purpose is a mixture obtained by simply heating together a mixture of limestone and sulfur, or carbonates of lime and sulfur, or some other substance containing in themselves, and lime sulfur - such as as alabaster, gypsum and etc. - With carbon or any other agent to remove part of the oxygen contained therein, or when heated lemon or lime carbonate gas or vapor containing sulfur.

The vehicle must be used to light the paint should be a kind of dry evaporation or oxidation, so that paint can not become soft or liquid by heat or should be easily erased by accident or through the use of devices for which it was applied. It can be any of the cars are widely used in oil painting or any of those commonly used in the so-called ""diseases"" whitewash or paint, depending on the location and purpose, or are afraid to be used.

These are the best results are obtained by mixing a phosphorescent substance with colorless varnish made from cement or other resinous body and soul or spirit as the paint as thick as convenient to apply with a brush, and with much spirit or spirit, can be added without prejudice to the required thickness. Good results can be obtained from linseed oil, varnishes spirit, glues, pastes, sizes and gelatin solutions of any kind, the choice of changing to meet the object in view or the nature of the articles on hand.

The method of applying the paint, varnish, or wash will depend on the circumstances of the case. For example, it can be applied with a brush, as in conventional painting or by dipping or soaking the article in the paint, varnish, or wash, or a block or type can be used for, as in the press and the like. In foreign policy, or where the surface is illuminated prone to the vagaries of weather or damage resulting from mechanical circumstances it is desirable to cover the glass or if the material will admit it, glaze it to flow, as in the enamel or, as in the ordinary courts, but this can be done without prejudice to the action, even if the thread or red icing requires a high temperature for fusion.

Among other applications of the invention said that may be listed, it is particularly beneficial to provide visible clock or watch parties and other indicators - such as, for example, compasses and scale of the barometer and thermometer - at night or in dark places at night. In applying the invention these and other similar purposes may be used phosphorous bases or dark shadowy figures in the field of law and phosphorescent numerals or letters, choose the former. Additionally, there may be letters and numbers, prepared for use at home and doors at the edges of the street, where it is not convenient and cost-effective to have an external light source, traffic signs and signals, as well as the names or marks to indicate records of roads and gates, and to like.

The invention also relates to painting with light rail cars with phosphorescent paint of the interior, thereby eliminating the need for cost and inconvenience of light passing through the tunnel.

 When in Peru, at Mancichi, I went into the guaca from which, in the sixteenth century, masses of gold of great value were extracted. 

 No trace of the precious metals has been found in the caverns which have served the natives of Guiana for ages as sepulchres. This circumstance proves that even at the period when the Caribs, and other travelling nations, made incursions to the south-west, gold had flowed in very small quantities from the mountains of Peru towards the eastern plains. 

 Wherever the granitic rocks do not present any of those large cavities caused by their decomposition, or by an accumulation of their blocks, the Indians deposit their dead in the earth. 

 The hammock (chinchorro), a kind of net in which the deceased had reposed during his life, serves for a coffin. 

 This net is fastened tight round the body, a hole is dug in the hut, and there the body is laid. This is the most usual method, according to the account of the missionary Gili, and it accords with what I myself learned from Father Zea. I do not believe that there exists one tumulus in Guiana, not even in the plains of the Cassiquiare and the Essequibo.
","Gold lust reigns supreme. It overcomes both the desire for learning and archeological research. Along the mountain ranges of South America, from Merida and Santa Martha to the Quito and Upper Peruvian plateaus, mining operations have been launched, or in the language of the Creoles, ""guacas"".

I visited the guaca in Mancichi, Peru, where in the sixteenth century large quantities of gold were mined. But no discovery of precious metals has been made in the caverns the Guiana people use for burial. This supports the theory that when the Caribs, and other nomads, travelled in the south-west, small quantities of gold flowed from the Peruvian mountains towards the eastern mesas. 

The local Indians bury their dead in the earth when they cannot find any large holes caused by the decomposition of granitic rocks. The deceased is wrapped tightly in his sleeping hammock. This hammock, made of net, is called a ""chinchorro"" in the local language,serves as shroud. The body is then buried in a hole dug in the hut, according to Gili, the missionary. I heard the same from Father Zea. In my opinion, there is not one mound in all of Guiana, not even in Cassiquiare and Essequibo.
